Personal Assistant

I have followed a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org to create this personal assistant.

The project has many flows and had to deal it with myself.
Note: The engine that I used is works with OS X, not Windows OS for that you need to use 'sapi5'

So for this project you need followings:

* Create an environment with Python = 3.7
* Activate the environment
* Install following packages via pip:
  * pip install pyttsx3
  * pip install SpeechRecognition
  * pip install pywhatkit
  * pip install wikipedia
  * pip install requests
  * pip install pyaudio

* Signup to the NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/) and get an API KEY (free) save it in file  .env
* Signup to the OPENWEATHERMAPAPI (https://openweathermap.org/) and get an API KEY (free) save it in file  .env
* Signup to the TheMovieDatabese TMDB_API (https://www.themoviedb.org/) and get an API KEY (free) save it in file  .env
